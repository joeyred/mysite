<html><head></head><body><h2>More Coming Soon.</h2>
<p>Cards have drastically changed, and currently are only usable with JavaScript. See
<a href="http://brianhayes.me/docs/pug/cards/">the documentation on the pug mixin for more</a>.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> <em>The documentation may currently be out of date with both the mixin,
and the pug mixin as cards now use the Expand Javascript module and not the old Card
module.</em></p>
