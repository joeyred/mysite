Two eCommerce based applications meant to add Image uploading, editing, and shopping cart integration in a Shopify store so customers can have them printed on various materials.

The Shopify application gave custom administration pages for downloading customer image files for printing, custom metafields for products, templates, snippets, and automatic asset injection for the storefront.

The storefront facing app handled image uploading, editing, adding items to the Shopify cart, and adding the proper field info on each product so the purchased items with custom images attached are easily and consistently handled.

<!-- ### Application Height Units

A react component meant to consistently manage component height in a way `vh` simply can't. This package is built to provide versions of this component that work with React with or without hooks, and Redux.

### Simply Animate

An animation utility that is extremely lightweight, while being insanely powerful.Meant to handle multi-step animation in an efficient and simple way, while still allowing things to get as complex as needed with a hook system that gives access to every part of an animation, on top of applying all kinds of helpful CSS classes to the passed element. This utility can also easily be added to bigger systems without any extra tweaking. -->

### My Personal Site --[link to portfolio page][2]--

- JavaScript
- SCSS
- Gulp
- Metalsmith
- Pug
- GitHub Pages

Built from the ground up. The built site has zero third party dependencies, and is built from a mobile-first mindset. Powered by a small JavaScript and SCSS library written from scratch.

The build pipeline is a mix of third party tools, and a lot of custom modules and plugins.

The process is meant to not only create a reflection of me, but my path of learning in web development. Something that is always ongoing.
