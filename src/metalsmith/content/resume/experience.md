### CropShop for Shopify --[link to portfolio page][1]--

Two eCommerce based applications meant to add Image uploading, editing, and adding to a shopping cart functionality in a Shopify store so customers can have them printed on various materials.

#### The Shopify Application

Uses React, Next.js, Koa, CSS, Webpack, MongoDB, Filestack API and is hosted via Heroku. Provides the user with a method by which to inject needed assets to the website, a button creator for opening the client side app on the storefront, a custom page for managing, zipping and downloading custom images on orders, and a custom product management page, for adding required dimension information.  

#### The Client Side Application

Uses React, Redux, SCSS, Filestack JavaScript SDK, Sentry, and many custom utilities and components.

<!-- ### Application Height Units

A react component meant to consistently manage component height in a way `vh` simply can't. This package is built to provide versions of this component that work with React with or without hooks, and Redux.

### Simply Animate

An animation utility that is extremely lightweight, while being insanely powerful.Meant to handle multi-step animation in an efficient and simple way, while still allowing things to get as complex as needed with a hook system that gives access to every part of an animation, on top of applying all kinds of helpful CSS classes to the passed element. This utility can also easily be added to bigger systems without any extra tweaking. -->

### My Personal Site --[link to portfolio page][2]--

a build system from the ground up using Gulp, Metalsmith, a huge amount of custom built utilities, plugins, parsers, etc... as well as from scratch JavaScript, SCSS, and Pug templates to build out the website.
