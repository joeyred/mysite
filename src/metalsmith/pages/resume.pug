                    Creatively driven and technical minded. I love coming up with the idea
                    just as much as I love bringing it to life. I want what I put my time
                    and effort into to be something I can be proud of. I have a wide 
                    variety of passions and interests, such as: design, music, writing, 
                    media production, art, cooking, mixology, video games, sports, 
                    and playing guitar.

                  h3 CropShop for Shopify
                  p.
                    Two eCommerce based applications meant to add Image uploading, editing, 
                    and adding to a shoping cart functionality in a Shopify store so customers 
                    can have them printed on various materials.
                  
                  h4 The Shopify Application
                  p.
                    Uses React, Next.js, Koa, CSS, Webpack, MongoDB, Filestack API and is 
                    hosted via Heroku. Provides the user with a method by which to inject 
                    needed assets to the website, a button creator for opening the client 
                    side app on the storefront, a custom page for managing, zipping and 
                    downloading custom images on orders, and a custom product management 
                    page, for adding required dimension information.  
                  
                  h4 The Client Side Application
                  p.
                    Uses React, Redux, SCSS, Filestack JavaScript SDK, Sentry, and many 
                    custom utilities and components.
                  
                  h3 Application Height Units
                  p.
                    A react component meant to consistently manage component height in a way `vh` simply can't.
                    This package is built to provide versions of this component that work with React with or
                    without hooks, and Redux.
                  
                  h3 Simply Animate
                  p.
                    An animation utility that is extremely lightweight, while being insanely powerful.
                    Meant to handle multi-step animation in an efficient and simple way, while still 
                    allowing things to get as complex as needed with a hook system that gives access to every
                    part of an animation, on top of applying all kinds of helpful CSS classes to the passed 
                    element. This utility can also easily be added to bigger systems without any extra tweaking.

                  p.
                    a build system from the ground up using Gulp, Metalsmith, a huge amount of custom 
                    built utilities, plugins, parsers, etc... as well as from scratch JavaScript, SCSS, and Pug templates to
                    build out the website.
